### **3. Communication Protocols: Detailed Answers**

#### **3.1 Email Size Limitations**
- **What is the maximum size of an email (including attachments)?**
  - Most email providers have a limit of **25MB** for an email, including the body, headers, and attachments.
  - However, due to MIME encoding (Base64), attachments increase in size by approximately 33%. A 25MB attachment will need ~33MB of space.

- **How do different email providers handle large emails?**
  - **Gmail**: Max size is **25MB**. Larger attachments are automatically converted to Google Drive links.
  - **Outlook/Office 365**: Max size is **20-25MB**, depending on the plan.
  - **Yahoo Mail**: Max size is **25MB**.

- **What happens when the size limit is exceeded?**
  - The email is rejected, and the sender receives a bounce-back message indicating the size exceeded the limit.

#### **3.2 Email Attachment Constraints**
- **What is the maximum attachment size supported by popular email services?**
  - The attachment size typically cannot exceed the overall email size limit. For Gmail and Outlook, the maximum attachment size is **25MB**.

- **How can large attachments be handled effectively?**
  - Use cloud storage services (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox) to share large files via links.
  - Compress files using tools like **ZIP** to reduce their size.

#### **3.3 SMS Character Limits**
- **What is the character limit for SMS messages?**
  - A single SMS message is limited to **160 characters** (standard GSM-7 encoding).
  - If the message contains non-GSM characters (e.g., emojis), it uses **Unicode (UCS-2)** encoding, reducing the limit to **70 characters**.

- **How are messages longer than the limit handled?**
  - Messages exceeding the limit are split into **concatenated SMS**:
    - GSM-7: Split into parts of **153 characters** each (7 characters reserved for headers).
    - UCS-2: Split into parts of **67 characters** each.

#### **3.4 MMS and Rich Media Messaging**
- **What are the size limits for multimedia messages (MMS)?**
  - **MMS Size Limits**:
    - **AT&T/Verizon/T-Mobile (USA)**: Max size is typically **300KB - 600KB**.
    - **Other carriers**: Limits vary between **100KB and 1MB**.

- **How do rich media messages (e.g., images, videos) affect delivery?**
  - Carriers often compress media, reducing quality.
  - Large media files may fail to deliver if they exceed the size limit.

#### **3.5 Web Push Notification Payload**
- **What is the payload size limit for web push notifications?**
  - Web push notifications typically allow a payload size of up to:
    - **Chrome/Edge**: 4KB.
    - **Firefox**: 4KB.
    - **Safari**: 4KB.

- **How does payload size affect performance?**
  - Smaller payloads result in faster delivery and reduced latency.
  - For larger payloads, include only a brief message and provide additional content via a URL link.

#### **3.6 Message Queue Constraints**
- **What are the size and message retention limits in messaging systems?**
  - **AWS SQS**:
    - Message size: **256KB**.
    - Message retention: Up to **14 days**.
  - **RabbitMQ**:
    - Message size: No hard limit, but large messages can degrade performance.
  - **Apache Kafka**:
    - Message size: Default is **1MB**, configurable up to **10MB+**.
    - Message retention: Configurable based on disk space and time.

- **How can you ensure reliable message delivery?**
  - Enable message persistence for critical data.
  - Use dead-letter queues to handle undeliverable messages.
  - Set up retry mechanisms with exponential backoff.
